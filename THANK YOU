Dear Sir Sumanta Mishra,

I would like to sincerely thank you for being an incredible Programming in C teacher. Your guidance and support have been invaluable throughout this learning journey.

Although I completed the 100-day coding challenge mostly through Google and sometimes by myself, your teachings laid the foundation that made it possible for me to understand and solve the problems effectively. Your dedication and patience have truly inspired me to keep learning and growing.

Thank you for all the help and encouragement you have given us. This experience has been very helpful, and I am grateful for everything you do as our mentor.

With gratitude,
Amita Singh
